# Vehicle-Emissions-Registrations-and-Sale-Forecasts-in-the-UK-and-Great-Britain
This report considers data from the onset of the production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as well as the data on petrol and diesel vehicle registrations up till the present day. The analysis of this data brings to light the financial implications of the electric vehicle production, sales, as well as the future projections of those sales, thus making a recommendation on the viability of the electric vehicle manufacturing industries. This study examined data from different reliable sources to look at market developments and how that is affecting the sales and demand of battery electric vehicles in contrast to electric combustion engine vehicles (ICE) in the UK and Great Britain, the factors that led to those changes, and the likelihood of probable changes in the coming years. Additionally, comparison of CO2 emissions between electric and diesel/petrol cars was done.
